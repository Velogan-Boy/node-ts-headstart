# Node Express Typescript Backend with PostgreSQL and Type ORM

This repository provides a headstart for developing a TypeScript Node.js backend application using Express, TypeORM, and other related technologies. It offers a structured foundation with boilerplate code and best practices to accelerate your development process.

> Note: Don't forget, this structure could be highly opinionated and you can always modify it to suit your needs.

## Tech Stack

-  [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
-  [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
-  [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
-  [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/)
-  [ZOD](https://zod.dev/)
-  [JWT](https://jwt.io/)

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed on your machine:

-  Node.js - [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
-  PostgreSQL - [Download and install PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Velogan-Boy/node-ts-headstart.git <project_name>

   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd <project_name>
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
      npm install
   ```

4. Create a new PostgreSQL database for your project.

5. Modify env files in the root directory of the project.

6. Run the following command to start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The server should now be running at http://localhost:8000.

> Note: Don't forget to uncomment the .env files in .gitignore file if you want to push your code to a remote repository.

## Happy Coding!
